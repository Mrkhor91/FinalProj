    <p>My first trip was to the Fairy meadows situated in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. I had to travel
      with a bunch of complete strangers in a travel group and it was such a life changing experience. I was able to
      meet a lot of people from different cultures and made a lot of friends during the journey as well. I was able to
      see the beautiful scenery and the beautiful people that live there, who had just bare minimum resources to
      survive but still they were happy and enjoying their lives, which is just a proof that happiness isnt associated
      with all the materislistic things that we do in our lives. <br>
      </p>

    <p>Coming back to the amazing scenery of Fairy meadows. That place is surely a piece of heaven, with lush green
      meadows and a beautiful view of the Nanga Parbat in the Background. We use to just sit there at night and get
      lost in the mighty beauty of Nanga Parbat. I will add some of the photos of that amazing place below</p>
